\subsection{Algorithm for Solving Optimization Applications}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Read and understand the situation.
		\item Draw a diagram (if necessary).
		\item Assign variables to quantities involved and state restrictions.
		\item Find relations (constraints) between these variables.
		\item Write the dependent variable (the one which is minimized or maximized) as a function of one single variable (the independent variable) by eliminating all unnecessary variables.
		\item Find extrema (maximum or minimum) for the dependant variable (using global extrema algorithm, first derivative test, or the second derivative test).
		\item Check if extrema satisfy the conditions of the application.
		\item Find the value of other variables at extrema (if necessary).
		\item Write the conclusion statement.
	\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Cost, Revenue, and Profit}
	Let $C(x)$ be the \emph{cost} of manufacturing $x$ units.

	The \emph{average cost per unit} is $u(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x}$.

	The \emph{marginal cost} is the cost of manufacturing the unit number $x$: $C(x) - C(x-1) \approx C'(x)$.

	Let $p(x)$ be the \emph{demand} function (\emph{price per unit} when selling $x$ units).

	The \emph{revenue} function is $R(x) = xp(x)$.

	The \emph{profit} function is $P(x) = R(x) - C(x)$.
