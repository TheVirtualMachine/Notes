\section{Volumes}
\subsection{Slices}
	If the cross-sectional area is a continuous function $A(x)$, then the volume between $x=a$ and $x=b$ may be computed by:
	\[V = \int_a^b A(x) \dif x\]
	where $\dif V = A(x) \dif x$ is the volume of a slice with the base area $A(x)$ and height $\dif x$.
\subsection{Disks (Horizontal Axis of Revolution)}
	The volume of a solid of revolution obtained by rotating the curve $y=R(x)$ about the $x$-axis is given by:
	\[V = \pi \int_a^b R^2(x) \dif x\]
	where $\dif V = \pi R^2(x) \dif x$ is the volume of a disk with the radius $R(x)$ and height $\dif x$.
\subsection{Disks (Vertical Axis of Revolution)}
	The volume of a solid of revolution obtained by rotating the curve $x = R(y)$ about the $y$-axis is given by:
	\[V = \pi \int_a^b R^2(y) \dif y\]
	where $\dif B = \pi R^2(y) \dif y$ is the volume of a disk with radius $R(y)$ and height $\dif y$.
\subsection{Washers}
	The volume of a solid of revolution bounded by an outer radius $R(x)$ and an inner radius $r(x)$ is given by:
	\[V = \pi \int_a^b \left( R^2(x) - r^2(x) \right) \dif x\]
	where $\dif V = \pi\left( R^2(x) - r^2(x) \right) \dif x$ is the volume of a washer with outer radius $R(x)$, inner radius $r(x)$, and height $\dif x$.
\subsection{Shells}
	The volume of a solid of revolution obtained by rotating about the $y$-axis the region under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is given by:
	\[V = 2\pi \int_a^b xf(x) \dif x \such 0 \leq a \leq b\]
	where $\dif V = 2\pi xf(x)\dif x$ is the volume of a shell with the radius $x$, height $f(x)$, and thickness $\dif x$.
