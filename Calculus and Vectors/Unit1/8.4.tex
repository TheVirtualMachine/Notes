\section{Vector and Parametric Equations of a Plane}
\subsection{Planes}
	A plane may be determined by points and lines.
	There are four main possibilities:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Plane determined by three points.
		\item Plane determined by two parallel lines.
		\item Plane determined by two intersecting lines.
		\item Plane determined by a point and a line.
	\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Vector Equation of a Plane}
	Consider a plane $\pi$.

	Two vectors $\vv{u}$ and $\vv{v}$, parallel to the plane $\pi$ but not parallel to each other, are called \emph{direction vectors} of the plane $\pi$.

	The vector $\vv{P_0P}$ from a specific point $P_0(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ to a generic point $P(x,y,z)$ of the plane is a \emph{linear combination} of direction vectors $\vv{u}$ and $\vv{v}$:
	\[\vv{P_0P} - s\vv{u} + t\vv{v} \such s, t \in \real\]
	The \emph{vector equation} of the plane is:
	\[\pi: \vv{r} = \vv{r_0} + s\vv{u} + t\vv{v} \such s, t \in \real\]
\subsection{Parametric Equations of a Plane}
	We write the vector equation of the plane as:
	\[(x,y,z) = (x_0,y_0,z_0) + s(u_x,u_y,u_z) + t(v_x,v_y,v_z)\]
	or:
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{cases}
			x = x_0 + su_x + tv_x\\
			y = y_0 + su_y + tv_y\\
			z = z_0 + su_z + tv_z
		\end{cases}
		s, t \in \real
	\end{equation*}
	These are the \emph{parametric equations} of a plane.
