\section{Cartesian Equation of a Line}
\subsection{Symmetric Equation}
	The parametric equations of a line in $\real^2$:
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{cases}
			x = x_0 + tu_x\\
			y = y_0 + tu_y
		\end{cases}
		t \in \real
	\end{equation*}
	may be written as:
	\[\frac{x - x_0}{u_x} = \frac{y - y_0}{u_y} = t \such t \in \real\]
	The \emph{symmetric equation} of the line is (if it exists):
	\[\frac{x - x_0}{u_x} = \frac{y - y_0}{u_y}\]
	\textbf{Note: The symmetric equations only exists if $u_x \neq 0$ and $u_y \neq 0$.}
\subsection{Normal Equation}
	Consider a line $L$ that passes through the specific point $P_0(x_0, y_0)$ and has the \emph{direction vector} $\vv{u} = (u_x, u_y)$.
	
	The vectors $\vv{n} = (-u_y, u_x) = (A, B)$ or $\vv{n} = (u_y, -u_x) = (A, B)$ are perpendicular to the vector $\vv{u}$ and so they are perpendicular to the line $L$.
	These are called \emph{normal vectors} to the line $L$.

	Let $P(x, y)$ be a generic point on the line $L$. So:
	\[\vv{P_0P} \parallel \vv{u} \implies \vv{P_0P} \perp \vv{n} \implies \vv{P_0P} \cdot \vv{n} = 0\]
	\[(\vv{r} - \vv{r_0}) \cdot \vv{n} = 0\]
	The \emph{normal equation} of a line is given by:
	\[(\vv{r} - \vv{r_0}) \cdot \vv{n} = 0\]
\subsection{Cartesian Equation}
	The normal equations can be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		\vv{r} \cdot \vv{n} - \vv{r_0} \cdot \vv{n} &= 0\\
		(x,y) \cdot (A,B) - (x_0,y_0) \cdot (A,B) &= 0\\
		Ax + By - Ax_0 - By_0 &= 0\\
		Ax + By + C &= 0 \qquad \text{where } C = -Ax_0 - By_0
	\end{align*}
	The \emph{Cartesian equation} of a line is given by:
	\[Ax + By + C = 0\]
	where
	$\vv{n} = (A,B)$ is a \emph{normal vector} and the constant $C$ depends on a specific point of the line.
\subsection{Slope $\boldsymbol{y}$-intercept Equation}
	Solve the symmetric equation of a line:
	\[\frac{x - x_0}{u_x} = \frac{y - y_0}{u_y} \such t \in \real\]
	for $y$:
	\begin{align*}
		y - y_0 &= u_y \frac{x - x_0}{u_x}\\
		y &= \frac{u_y}{u_x}x + y_0 - \frac{u_y}{u_x}x_0
	\end{align*}
	The \emph{slope $y$-intercept equation} of a line in $\real^2$ is given by:
	\[y = mx + b\]
	\[m = \frac{u_y}{u_x}\]
	where $m$ is the \emph{slope} and  $b$ is the \emph{$y$-intercept} which depends on a specific point of the line.
\subsection{Angle between Two Lines}
	The \emph{angle} between two lines is determined by the angle between the \emph{direction vectors}:
	\[\cos \theta = \frac{\vv{u_1} \cdot \vv{u_2}}{\norm{\vv{u_1}} \norm{\vv{u_2}}}\]
	\textbf{Note: There are two pairs of equal angles between the two lines.
	There is a pair of the angle $\theta_1$, and a pair of the angle $\theta_2$.
	$\theta_1 + \theta_2 = \SI{180}{\degree}$}
