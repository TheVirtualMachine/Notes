\section{Cartesian Equation of a Plane}
\subsection{Normal Equation of a Plane}
	A plane may be determined by a \emph{point} $P_0(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and a \emph{vector} perpendicular to the plane $\vv{n}$ called the \emph{normal vector}.

	If $P(x,y,z)$ is a generic point on the plane, then:
	\[\vv{P_0P} \perp \vv{n}\]
	and:
	\[\vv{P_0P} \cdot \vv{n} = 0\]
	This is the \emph{normal equation} of a plane.
\subsection{Cartesian Equation of a Plane}
	We write the normal vector of a plane in the form:
	\[\vv{n} = (A, B, C)\]
	Then, the normal equation may be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		(x - x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0) \cdot (A, B, C) &= 0\\
		Ax + By + Cz - Ax_0 - By_0 - Cz_0 &= 0
	\end{align*}
	or:
	\[Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\]
	which is called the \emph{Cartesian equation} of a plane.

	\textbf{Note: A normal vector to the plane is:
	\[\vv{n} = \vv{u} \times \vv{v}\]
	where $\vv{u}$ and $\vv{v}$ are the direction vectors of the plane.}
\subsection{Angle between Two Planes}
	The \emph{angle} between two planes is defined as the angle between their \emph{normal vectors}:
	\[\cos \theta = \frac{\vv{n_1} \cdot \vv{n_2}}{\norm{\vv{n_1}} \norm{\vv{n_2}}}\]
	\textbf{Note: Using this formula, you may get an \emph{acute} or an \emph{obtuse} angle depending on the normal vectors which are used.}
